name: free-models-monitor
description: Checks whether free-tier LLM models on OpenRouter and Groq were added or removed, optionally detects models approaching the paid coding and agentic frontier, and helps decide what to do about it. Use whenever the user asks to check free model status, find a strong free development model, run the model monitor, or handle a model that stopped being free.

# free-models-monitor

This skill wraps two CLI tools that live in this repository:
`free_models_monitor.monitor` (the check) and `free_models_monitor.switch`
(the fix). They are plain Python 3.9+, stdlib only, and behave the same way
in any agent harness, or with no agent at all.

## 1. Run the monitor

```bash
python3 -m free_models_monitor.monitor --format json
```

First time on a machine, initialize instead so it does not report every
existing free model as "added":

```bash
python3 -m free_models_monitor.monitor --init
```

Add `--scan-dir <path>` (repeatable) for every directory that holds your
agent configs, so a removal can be matched to the configs that reference it.

For low-noise development-model alerts, add one of:

```bash
# Include capable new models whose benchmark data is still pending
python3 -m free_models_monitor.monitor --quality-filter candidate --format json

# Report only models confirmed near the current paid frontier
python3 -m free_models_monitor.monitor --quality-filter frontier --format json
```

Quality mode requires tool support and at least 128K context. Its default
thresholds are 90% of the best paid coding score and 80% of the best paid
agentic score in the current OpenRouter catalog.

Read the exit code before reading the output:

- `0`: nothing changed. Nothing else to do.
- `2`: something changed. Read the JSON body.
- `1`: the check itself failed (network error, bad state dir). Report the
  stderr message to the user; do not treat this as "no free models".

## 2. Interpret the output

With `--format json` the body has:

```json
{
  "changed": true,
  "changes": [{"type": "added", "model_id": "...", "model_info": {"name": "...", "context_length": 0}}],
  "affected_configs": {"<model_id>": [{"file": "/path/to/config", "agent": "relative/path"}]},
  "switches": [{"from": "...", "to": "...", "to_name": "..."}],
  "provider_counts": {"openrouter": 0, "groq": 0}
}
```

`changes[].type` is `"added"`, `"removed"`, `"quality_candidate"`, or
`"quality_confirmed"`.

- `type: "added"`: informational. Mention it, no action needed.
- `type: "quality_candidate"`: a tool-capable, long-context free model has
  incomplete benchmarks. Mention it as promising but unconfirmed.
- `type: "quality_confirmed"`: the free model crossed both dynamic quality
  thresholds and is worth evaluating on the user's own repository.
- `type: "removed"`: this is the case that matters. Check `affected_configs`
  for that model id, and `switches` for the suggested replacement.

Use `--format text` instead when the output goes straight into a chat
message (Telegram, WhatsApp, Slack), it is plain text, no markdown.

## 3. Decide what to do about a removal

1. If `affected_configs` lists files for the removed model, tell the user
   which configs are affected before changing anything.
2. If a `switches` entry has a `to` value, that is the suggested
   replacement. If `to` is null, no fallback was found, say so plainly
   instead of guessing a model id.
3. Only change a config file with explicit confirmation, unless the user
   has already told this skill to auto-apply. To apply:

```bash
python3 -m free_models_monitor.switch \
  --from "<removed model id>" \
  --to "<replacement model id>" \
  --file /path/to/config1 --file /path/to/config2 \
  --apply
```

   This backs up each file first (`<file>.bak-<timestamp>`) and only then
   edits it. Omit `--apply` (or pass `--dry-run`) to show the plan without
   touching anything.
4. If the harness needs a restart or reload after a config swap (OpenClaw's
   gateway, for example), that step belongs to the harness adapter, not to
   this skill. Check `adapters/<your-harness>/README.md` in this repository.

## 4. Notify, if asked to

If the user wants proactive alerts instead of on-demand checks, either:

- Let this skill's harness scheduler (cron, `/loop`, a harness's own cron
  equivalent) call `python3 -m free_models_monitor.monitor --notify
  <channel>` on a schedule, with the channel's credentials in the
  environment (see `README.md`, "Notification setup"). The tool only
  notifies when something changed, unless `--notify-always` is set.
- Or run the check yourself in the conversation and relay the result if the
  user is asking interactively.

## Harness-specific setup

This skill only covers the CLI. For how to install and schedule this repo
inside a specific harness, see:

- `adapters/hermes/README.md`
- `adapters/claude-code/README.md`
- `adapters/cron/README.md`
